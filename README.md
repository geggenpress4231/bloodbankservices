#BloodBank Application
##Overview
The BloodBank application is designed to facilitate the management of blood donors and seekers, enhancing the efficiency of connecting blood seekers with potential donors. Developed using Spring MVC for the backend, this application leverages the power of Java Persistence API (JPA) for ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) to interact seamlessly with a MySQL database. This README provides an overview of the application's functionality, setup instructions, and details on how it utilizes Spring MVC and JPA.

Features
Seeker Management: Allows users to add, update, and remove seekers who are looking for blood donations.
Database Integration: Uses a MySQL database to store information about seekers, including their name and blood type.
RESTful API: Provides a RESTful interface for managing seekers, enabling CRUD operations through HTTP requests.
Technologies Used
Spring Boot: For creating the MVC web application.
Spring Data JPA: For database interaction and ORM.
MySQL: As the underlying database for storing application data.
Maven: For project management and build automation.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
JDK 17
Maven 3.2+
MySQL 5.6 or later
Setup and Installation
Clone the repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bloodbank-application.git
cd bloodbank-application
Configure MySQL Database
Create a MySQL database and update the application.properties file with your MySQL username and password.

properties
Copy code
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/<databasename>
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=password
Run the Application
Use Maven to run the application.

bash
Copy code
mvn spring-boot:run
The application will be accessible at http://localhost:8080.

API Endpoints
GET /seekers: Fetch all seekers.
GET /seekers/{id}: Fetch a seeker by ID.
POST /seekers: Add a new seeker.
PUT /seekers/{id}: Update an existing seeker's details.
DELETE /seekers/{id}: Remove a seeker from the database.
Understanding the Implementation
Model-View-Controller (MVC) Architecture: The application follows the MVC pattern, with Spring MVC facilitating the separation of concerns, making the application easy to manage and scale.
Java Persistence API (JPA): JPA is used for ORM to map Java objects to database tables. This application uses Spring Data JPA to abstract away the boilerplate code required for database operations.
Repository Pattern: Utilizes Spring Data JPA repositories to encapsulate the set of objects persisted in a database and operations that can be performed on them.
